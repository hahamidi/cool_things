## Annotate images for use in your computer vision projects.

[Roboflow Annotation Tools Documentation](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate/annotation-tools)


Roboflow Annotate provides a fast, robust interface for annotating images, making it easy to create training data for your computer vision models. You can annotate images using bounding boxes and polygons with various methods to suit your needs.

# Annotation Methods
Roboflow Annotate offers multiple ways to label your images:

Manual Annotation: Draw bounding boxes and polygons directly on images.

Label Assist: Uses model checkpoints (previous versions of your model) to suggest annotations, speeding up the labeling process.

Smart Polygon: Allows you to create polygon annotations quickly with just a few clicks, enhancing the efficiency of the annotation process.

Label Assist with SAM: Utilizes the Segment Anything Model to generate more precise polygon annotations with minimal clicks, improving annotation accuracy.
